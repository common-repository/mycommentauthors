Publish a list of your commentators and their number of comments for a certain month on a blog post

== Description ==
Generate a list of your comment authors for a given month of the year. Then create a blog post to thank them for commenting on your blog. 

This is a great way to attract more repeat visit to your blog. By publishing a list of your commentators, you make them feel welcome and encouraged

For those who are more active, you may want to give them a dofollow link on the list by setting a certain number of comments that will be required for the dofollow link to be enabled.
